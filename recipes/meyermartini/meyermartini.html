    <h1>Meyer Lemon Martini</h1>
    <img src="martini.jpg" alt="Meyer Lemon Martini">

    <p>Meyer lemons, a cross between a lemon and an orange, have a sweeter, less acidic flavor than the more common lemon. If you have to use a regular lemon, add a little extra sugar to taste. For the ultimate martini, use good quality vodka and orange liqueur. I should have named this the 'come to papa' martini!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons warm water</li>
        <li>1 Meyer lemon, juiced and peeled</li>
        <li>2 fluid ounces vodka</li>
        <li>1 fluid ounce orange-flavored liqueur (such as Cointreau)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or as needed for rimming</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 teaspoons sugar and warm water in a cocktail shaker; stir to dissolve sugar. Pour Meyer lemon juice, lemon peels, vodka, and orange liqueur into the shaker; add ice. Cover and shake vigorously.</li>
        <li>Remove a lemon peel from the shaker and wipe the rim of a martini glass with the peel. Dip the rim of the glass in 1 teaspoon sugar, or as needed. Strain martini into prepared glass.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>Two teaspoons of simple syrup can be used to sweeten the martini instead of the sugar and water. To make 1 and 1/2 cups simple syrup, bring 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup water to a boil until sugar is melted. After cooling the syrup, store it in the fridge. It will keep several weeks.</p>
